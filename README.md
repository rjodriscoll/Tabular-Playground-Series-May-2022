# Tabular-Playground-Series-May-2022

The May edition of the 2022 Tabular Playground series binary classification problem that includes a number of different feature interactions. This competition is an opportunity to explore various methods for identifying and exploiting these feature interactions.

For this challenge, you are given (simulated) manufacturing control data and are tasked to predict whether the machine is in state 0 or state 1. The data has various feature interactions that may be important in determining the machine state.

Good luck!
